## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

* ALTER Tables
* Updates
* Inserts

## Details

### Deliverables

* A Git repo fork of movie-sql-part-2
* A .sql (text) file with each of the required queries 

### Requirements  

* Need to work on provided database

## Normal Mode

Complete the following aggregation objectives:

* Get the average rating for a movie
* Get the total ratings for a movie
* Get the total movies for a genre
* Get the average rating for a user

* Find the user with the most ratings
* Find the user with the highest average rating
* Find the user with the highest average rating with more than 50 reviews
* Find the movies with an average rating over 4

Complete the following modification objectives:

* Create a new table called actors (We are going to pretend the actor can only play in one movie)
The table should include name, character name, foreign key to movies and date of birth at least plus an id field.
* Pick 3 movies and create insert statements for 10 actors each.  You should use the multi value insert statements
* Create a new column in the movie table to hold the MPAA rating.
UPDATE 5 different movies to their correct rating


## Hard Mode
* Create a new field on the movies table for the year.  Using an update query and a substring method update that column for every movie with the year found in the title column.
HINT:

* Now that we know we can add actors create a join table between actors and movies.  This table should not only have the foreign keys for each of the tables, include an extra field for the character name for the actor.  Use the current actor table to populate the join table with data including the characterâ€™s name
